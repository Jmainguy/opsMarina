# opsMarina
DevOps Collection of CLI tools

## Give me the tools
See the [releases](https://github.com/slmingol/opsMarina/releases) page and grab the assets there based on your operating system.

## Purpose
The purpose of this git repo is to act as a meta repo for other git repos. Using CI we automate releases to grab binaries from other projects, and place them inside a single archive (for Linux/MacOS). The vision is for others to consume the releases here to have a single place to grab tools they use everyday.

## Projects included

  * [escli](https://github.com/slmingol/escli)
